# ws MCP Operations Runbook

Operational runbook for the host-neutral `ws-mcp` runtime used by the `ws`
plugin package.

This file is not the MCP tool contract or current tool inventory. Caller-visible
behavior belongs in specs, and modification-relevant coupling belongs in mental
models:

- MCP behavior contract: `ai-docs/spec/mcp-tools.md`
- plugin launcher and release contract: `ai-docs/spec/plugin-runtime.md`
- named-agent behavior contract: `ai-docs/spec/named-agent-runtime.md`
- MCP implementation mental model: `ai-docs/mental-model/mcp-runtime.md`
- plugin packaging mental model: `ai-docs/mental-model/plugin-runtime.md`
- named-agent mental model: `ai-docs/mental-model/named-agent-runtime.md`

For live tool schemas and current inventory, ask the runtime: use MCP
`tools/list`, `ws/runtime.info`, `ws-mcp runtime capabilities`, or the source
registry in `agents-plugin-tool/internal/mcp/server.go`.

## Process Model

The baseline server is stdio MCP, not a background OS daemon.

```bash
ws-mcp serve --stdio --root <repo-root>
```

The host launches the command and communicates over stdin/stdout JSON-RPC. The
server advertises MCP protocol version `2025-03-26` and tool capability.

Local command examples:

```bash
ws-mcp version
ws-mcp doctor --root <repo-root>
ws-mcp runtime info
ws-mcp runtime capabilities
ws-mcp serve --stdio --root <repo-root>
```

`doctor` is a host-independent smoke check. In this repository it verifies the
repository root, `ai-docs/`, `agents-plugin/`, and `ai-docs/_index.md`;
downstream projects should rely on MCP tools for bundled conventions rather
than repository-local source paths.

## Plugin-Managed Startup

Codex plugin bundles can reference plugin-local MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "skills": "./skills/",
  "mcpServers": "./.mcp.json"
}
```

The plugin-local `.mcp.json` starts the runtime through the Python launcher:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ws": {
      "command": "python3",
      "cwd": ".",
      "args": ["./bin/ws-mcp-launcher.py", "serve", "--stdio"],
      "startup_timeout_sec": 30,
      "tool_timeout_sec": 600
    }
  }
}
```

`cwd: "."` is intentional. Codex normalizes it to the installed plugin cache so
`./bin/ws-mcp-launcher.py` resolves inside the plugin package. Because that also
makes the MCP process cwd the plugin cache, tools must not infer the project
root from process cwd.

The launcher exports `WS_MCP_PROJECT_ROOT` when it can infer the caller project
root from the parent Codex process. Skills may still pass explicit absolute
roots for compatibility, and lead actor setup should pass the repository's
absolute filesystem path.

Native Windows plugin-managed startup uses the same Python launcher. Windows
users need a working `python3` command on `PATH`; if the Windows Store alias is
present without Python installed, install Python 3 and refresh the plugin.

## Launcher Environment

Current launcher inputs:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `WS_MCP_RUNTIME_DIR` | Override the runtime binary directory; defaults to plugin-local `.runtime/<os>-<arch>`. |
| `WS_MCP_RUNTIME_BINARY` | Exact repaired runtime binary path exported by the launcher for async worker recovery. |
| `WS_MCP_BOOTSTRAP_BINARY` | Copy a prebuilt local binary into the runtime directory. |
| `WS_MCP_BOOTSTRAP_URL` | Download a prebuilt binary when no runtime binary exists. |
| `WS_MCP_BOOTSTRAP_SHA256` | Optional SHA-256 checksum for `WS_MCP_BOOTSTRAP_URL`. |
| `WS_MCP_RELEASE_REPOSITORY` | Override the GitHub release repository from `runtime.json`. |
| `WS_MCP_RELEASE_TAG` | Override the release tag from `runtime.json`, for example `v0.33.5`. |
| `WS_MCP_RELEASE_BASE_URL` | Override the full release asset base URL; useful for local file or HTTP smoke tests. |
| `WS_MCP_LAUNCHER_DEBUG` | Print launcher diagnostics to stderr when set to `1`. |
| `WS_MCP_PROJECT_ROOT` | Project root default for root-aware tools and CLI commands when no higher-priority root exists. |
| `WS_MCP_NO_AGENT` | Product-mode gate for agentless distributions such as wsflow. |
| `WS_MCP_NAMESPACE` | User-facing MCP namespace text override; empty or unset defaults to `ws`. |
| `WS_MCP_SETUP_TOOL` | Advertised setup tool name override; empty or unset defaults to `ws.setup`. |

Launcher diagnostics must go to stderr. Stdout belongs to the MCP JSON-RPC
stream until the launcher execs the repaired runtime.

## Runtime Repair And Drift

The launcher reads plugin-local `runtime.json`, repairs a missing or
incompatible runtime binary, then execs `ws-mcp`.

Runtime binaries live in the installed plugin cache by default:

```text
<installed-plugin-cache>/.runtime/<os>-<arch>/ws-mcp-<plugin-version>-<runtime-json-sha12>[.exe]
```

Compatibility checks use `ws-mcp runtime capabilities` when available. That
single probe reports runtime version, source commit, MCP protocol version,
prompt bundle metadata, MCP tool names, and CLI command names needed by the
launcher. Older runtimes fall back to bounded legacy validation when the
contract allows it.

`runtime.json` is active compatibility data, not release notes. Version, tool,
command, and prompt-bundle drift can make a working binary stale. Use the
version bump helper instead of editing release/version references by hand:

```bash
agents-plugin-tool/scripts/bump-ws-version.sh <X.Y.Z>
```

The helper updates plugin manifests, runtime contracts, Go runtime development
defaults, release workflow references, build script defaults, and selected
documentation references. Development binaries such as `0.33.5-dev` satisfy
plugin `0.29.2`; older or newer minor releases are stale.

## Release Distribution

`ws-mcp` is distributed as prebuilt native binaries produced from
`agents-plugin-tool/`. End users should not need Go, Node, Cargo, or Visual
Studio Build Tools to run the MCP server.

Release asset names follow this pattern:

```text
ws-mcp-<os>-<arch>[.exe]
```

Initial assets:

```text
ws-mcp-darwin-arm64
ws-mcp-darwin-amd64
ws-mcp-linux-amd64
ws-mcp-linux-arm64
ws-mcp-windows-amd64.exe
ws-mcp-windows-arm64.exe
SHA256SUMS
```

`SHA256SUMS` is a plain `shasum -a 256` manifest covering every release binary.
The launcher verifies the matching checksum line before chmod/exec. Offline or
proxy failures should keep stdout clean and report the URL or runtime directory
that needs manual repair.

The local build script is:

```bash
agents-plugin-tool/scripts/build-release-assets.sh [version]
```

GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/ws-mcp-release.yml` runs tests,
cross-compiles assets, uploads workflow artifacts, and publishes GitHub release
assets for pushed `v*` tags. Pull requests touching workflow or plugin/runtime
paths run checks without publishing.

## Local Devenv Repair

Local development has one repository-specific repair exception. When the
installed plugin path is under `~/.codex/plugins/cache/kang-sw-devenv/<ws|wsflow>/`
or `~/.claude/plugins/cache/kang-sw-devenv/<ws|wsflow>/` and the installed cache
contains a valid `.local-devenv-runtime` contract, the launcher forces local
runtime repair before accepting an already compatible cache-local binary. Both
the Codex and Claude plugin caches are recognized so the same source-build
dogfood loop works on either host.

The contract format is:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "source_root": "/Users/kang-sw/devenv",
  "tool_dir": "/Users/kang-sw/devenv/agents-plugin-tool",
  "go": "/opt/homebrew/bin/go"
}
```

All paths must be absolute. `source_root` and `tool_dir` must exist, `tool_dir`
must contain `cmd/ws-mcp`, and `go` must be an existing file (an executable bit is
required on POSIX; on Windows the `go.exe` file is trusted because
`os.access(X_OK)` is not meaningful there). If the marker is missing, invalid
JSON, missing required fields, or references missing paths, local repair is
inactive and the launcher uses the normal cache/release path. Local devenv repair
is honored on all platforms including Windows; the build inherits a launch
environment with `HOME` recovered on POSIX and `USERPROFILE`/`LOCALAPPDATA`
recovered on Windows so `go build` resolves its module/build caches under a
sanitized launch env.

When the contract is valid, the forced local path builds
`<tool_dir>/cmd/ws-mcp` with the declared Go executable first so pre-release
dogfood exercises the current checkout. Non-forced repair may copy a local
runtime binary from `<tool_dir>/dist/` or the contract-addressed
`<source_root>/agents-plugin/.runtime/<os>-<arch>/ws-mcp-<plugin-version>-<runtime-json-sha12>`
path before building. Legacy fixed-name source-cache binaries such as
`agents-plugin/.runtime/darwin-arm64/ws-mcp` are not local repair candidates.

If no compatible local runtime can be installed while a valid marker is active,
startup fails instead of falling back to the published release asset.

### Enabling the local dogfood loop (manual setup)

The marker is per-machine and gitignored, so place it once in the source
checkout for each package you dogfood, then let the plugin install or refresh
copy it into the plugin cache:

1. Write `agents-plugin/.local-devenv-runtime` with this machine's absolute
   paths (use `command -v go` for the Go path). If dogfooding the separate
   wsflow package, write the same marker to
   `agents-plugin-wsflow/.local-devenv-runtime`:

   ```json
   {
     "schema_version": 1,
     "source_root": "/home/you/devenv",
     "tool_dir": "/home/you/devenv/agents-plugin-tool",
     "go": "/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/go"
   }
   ```

2. Run `./install.sh update`. The `rsync` step copies the marker into the
   plugin snapshot and `claude plugin install` carries it into the versioned
   cache, so the next MCP launch source-builds the current checkout.

After setup, editing the Go source and reconnecting the MCP server is enough to
pick up changes — no rebuild-and-stage step. To disable, delete the marker and
re-run `install.sh update` (the launcher reverts to the cache/release path).

This path exists only for the repository-local Codex or Claude plugin
development loop. The marker file is gitignored and should not exist in normal
GitHub release installs, downstream repositories, or Windows installs.

## Development Verification

Use three verification levels while developing `ws-mcp` and plugin-managed
runtime behavior.

Level 1 validates the Go runtime and host-independent MCP server:

```bash
cd agents-plugin-tool
go test ./...
scripts/smoke-ws-mcp.sh ..
```

Level 2 validates local release assets:

```bash
cd agents-plugin-tool
scripts/build-release-assets.sh 0.33.5-dev
dist/ws-mcp-darwin-arm64 version
cd dist
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS
```

Level 3 validates Codex plugin-managed MCP startup from the installed plugin
cache. This level requires a human-in-the-loop plugin cache refresh when plugin
files change: uninstall/install `ws` in the Codex UI or start a fresh session
after cache refresh is available. Then run:

```bash
codex mcp get ws
codex exec --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --json \
  'There is an enabled MCP server named ws. Use its tool named project_tree with arguments {"root":"/Users/kang-sw/devenv"}. Do not use shell commands. Reply with the exact server name, exact tool name, and the first non-empty line of the tool result.' \
  < /dev/null
```

Success means the JSONL output contains an MCP tool call with server `ws`, tool
`project_tree`, and a result whose first non-empty line is `ai-docs/`.

Use Level 1 for ordinary Go/MCP changes, Level 2 for release/build changes, and
Level 3 whenever `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, launcher behavior, or
installed plugin packaging changes.

## Troubleshooting

- MCP startup fails before JSON-RPC: inspect launcher stderr; stdout must remain
  clean.
- Plugin-managed root resolution points at the plugin cache: pass an explicit
  absolute `root`, call setup with the repository's absolute filesystem path, or
  check `WS_MCP_PROJECT_ROOT` propagation.
- Installed plugin files changed but Codex still starts old behavior: refresh
  the plugin cache through UI uninstall/install or a fresh Codex session.
- Runtime surface mismatch: run `ws-mcp runtime capabilities` against the
  cache-local binary and compare it with `runtime.json`.
- Windows startup reports Python alias problems: install Python 3 and refresh
  the plugin so Codex rematerializes the MCP entry.
- Routing or implementation context lost after context compaction: expected — the
  transcript is summarized, but session state persists in
  `<cache-root>/keys/<session-key>.json`. Recover by calling
  `ws.workflow_manual(session_key: <key preserved in the compaction summary>)`,
  which reloads the manual primitives and restores the agenda/todo Session State.
  Do not call `ws.ferrule` to "re-enter" — it is non-idempotent and mints a new key,
  orphaning the prior state.
