# ws Web Dashboard

The ws web dashboard provides a personal browser-accessible control plane for a
host machine. It serves dashboard UI, gates host-control actions behind owner
authentication, and consumes ws runtime state through daemon-owned view models.

## Daemon Foundation {#260515-ws-web-daemon-foundation}

The dashboard daemon starts through the `ws-dashboard serve` command as a
Rust/Axum HTTP server with explicit serving configuration, structured startup
logging, graceful shutdown, and a minimal health surface. The default bind
target is `127.0.0.1`. The daemon does not treat loopback access as
authorization.

On startup, the daemon creates an in-memory high-entropy one-time pairing token
with an explicit expiry policy and exposes the corresponding pairing URL to the
local owner through startup output. The pairing route is the only
unauthenticated browser entrypoint. A successful pairing exchange consumes the
token, installs an HTTP-only owner session cookie with `SameSite=Lax`, and lets
the browser access authenticated routes. Missing, invalid, reused, or expired
pairing tokens fail without installing a session cookie.

Authenticated owner sessions have broad host-control authority for dashboard
features, but the daemon remains separate from ws MCP stdio session authority.
The daemon must not make itself the canonical ws MCP root, harness, model
backend, or named-agent session owner.

HTTP routes other than pairing reject unauthenticated requests before handler
execution, including the health route, the placeholder UI route, and fallback
paths. Browser-facing authentication uses a normal HTTP-only session cookie.
The daemon also accepts a narrow bearer authentication path for CLI and smoke
callers against protected HTTP routes; bearer auth supplements browser cookie
navigation and does not replace it.

Browser entrypoints reject clearly invalid Host and Origin values while
preserving ordinary loopback development usage. Future WebSocket upgrade
requests enter the owner-auth gate before any upgrade acceptance; the foundation
does not yet expose WebSocket endpoint behavior.

Serving configuration supports explicit `local`, `tunnel`, and `public` bind
modes. Local mode remains the default and binds to loopback unless the caller
changes the host. Tunnel mode preserves loopback-oriented serving intent for
external tunnel frontends. Non-loopback hosts such as `0.0.0.0` are rejected
unless the caller explicitly selects public mode. Public mode can accept a
non-loopback host only while owner authentication is enabled; bind-mode
acceptance does not relax browser cookie auth, bearer auth, Host/Origin checks,
or WebSocket pre-upgrade auth.

The initial UI route serves a minimal placeholder surface behind owner
authentication. Health output is the exact minimal body `ok\n`; host paths,
cache paths, Git roots, pairing tokens, session values, diagnostics, and wsstate
internals are not URL identity and are not exposed by the health surface.

## Core Resource Vocabulary {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-core-resource-vocabulary}

The dashboard core crate exposes opaque ids and resource path vocabulary for
the first visible hierarchy without exposing host paths as identity. Core
resource paths carry `serverId`, `workspaceId`, `workRootId`, and optional
`instanceId` fields when serialized for dashboard consumers.

The physical directory target is named `workRoot` in the public dashboard core
vocabulary. WorkRoot metadata distinguishes `plainDirectory`, `gitPrimaryRoot`,
and `gitLinkedWorktree`; status values describe whether the remembered root is
online, offline, moved, or inaccessible. Main/sub instance role, instance kind,
and interaction mode values serialize with the same dashboard camelCase naming
contract.

## Resource View-Model Contract {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-resource-view-model-contract}

The dashboard exposes authenticated HTTP view-model APIs for the first visible
resource hierarchy:

```text
server -> workspace -> workRoot -> mainInstance -> subInstance
```

Callers address API resources through opaque ids rather than host paths, Git
roots, wsstate paths, workRoot keys, or runtime session identifiers. The daemon
owns those private identifiers and exposes only authenticated view-model fields
that the browser needs to render navigation, selection, status,
stale/error/loading state, and available actions.

`workspace` means a daemon-discovered project group, not a user-created
category. `workRoot` means the physical directory used as an open, spawn, and
run target. WorkRoots report additive kind metadata for `plainDirectory`,
`gitPrimaryRoot`, or `gitLinkedWorktree`, plus status such as online, offline,
moved, or inaccessible. Primary roots and linked Git worktrees share the same
core workRoot API shape while preserving enough metadata for the UI to
distinguish their repository role and lifecycle affordances.

The API shape preserves the full hierarchy even when the browser later renders
singleton `workspace -> workRoot -> mainInstance` chains as compact rows.
Authenticated callers may observe compactability hints, but compaction is a
presentation policy and not URL identity.

## Mock View-Model Fixtures {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-mock-view-model-fixtures}

The dashboard daemon provides deterministic fixture-backed resource data that
uses the same view-model API contract as live providers. Frontend and contract
tests can render the first visible shell without live wsstate, PTY, named-agent,
harness, or filesystem discovery dependencies.

Fixtures cover singleton chains, multi-root workspaces, plain directories, Git
primary roots, linked Git worktrees, offline or inaccessible workRoots, main
instances, sub instances, stale/error/loading states, and visible action hints.
Protected API route tests verify that fixture-backed dashboard data remains
behind the owner-auth boundary.

## Protected Frontend Shell {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-protected-frontend-shell}

The dashboard daemon serves the first React/TypeScript/Vite browser shell
behind the same owner-auth boundary as other protected dashboard routes. Static
asset serving does not add another unauthenticated top-level route beside
`/pair`; unauthenticated browser requests for the dashboard shell are rejected
before assets or fallback UI are served.

The frontend package provides documented local development and production build
entrypoints that later dashboard slices can reuse. The first shell remains
narrow: it does not implement PTY, editor, document viewer, live workspace
discovery, event streams, named-agent controls, or root picker behavior.

## Inspectable Navigation Shell {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-inspectable-navigation-shell}

The first browser shell renders the resource view-model contract from the
daemon API. It shows server, workspace, workRoot, main-instance, and
sub-instance state; loading, empty, stale, and error states; compact singleton
rows; and a reserved right-side viewer region without implementing the deferred
viewer feature.

Mouse-triggered navigation actions route through command ids so later keyboard
bindings can call the same commands. The shell reserves `^b` to
mean ctrl plus lowercase `b`; full custom keybinding UI remains out of scope.

## Local WorkRoot Discovery Provider {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-local-workroot-discovery-provider}

The dashboard daemon provides a live local discovery provider that maps opened
physical directories into the resource view-model contract. The provider
classifies workRoots as `plainDirectory`, `gitPrimaryRoot`, or
`gitLinkedWorktree`, reports online, offline, moved, and inaccessible states,
and preserves stable daemon-owned identity when a workRoot's discovered kind
changes.

Discovery refreshes through explicit owner actions that invoke the provider,
including opening a workRoot through the root picker backend. Broad filesystem
watching remains out of scope for the first visible substrate.

## Root Picker Empty Directory Creation {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-root-picker-empty-directory-creation}

The dashboard exposes backend support for a cross-platform root picker that
lists filesystem locations as workRoot candidates without turning the browser
into a general file manager. Authenticated owners can open existing plain
directories or Git-backed directories into the dashboard model.

The picker includes only a narrow `Create empty folder` operation for creating
a new workRoot candidate. Generic delete, rename, move, copy, and recursive
folder deletion operations remain unavailable.

## 🚧 Instance Event Envelope Fixtures {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-instance-event-envelope-fixtures}

The dashboard will define a shared event envelope for instance-scoped streams.
Events will reference opaque server, workspace, workRoot, and instance ids from
the resource view-model contract, carry ordered cursor or sequence data,
timestamps, event categories, payload values, and explicit error or end markers.

Deterministic transcript fixtures will cover ordinary output, status
transitions, errors, reconnect/backfill, and empty streams so later PTY,
named-agent, exec, diagnostic, viewer, and translation features can reuse one
stream shape.

## 🚧 Authenticated Instance Event Stream Scaffold {#260516-ws-web-dashboard-authenticated-instance-event-stream-scaffold}

The dashboard will expose an authenticated stream route scaffold that serves
fixture-backed instance events before live PTY, named-agent, exec, diagnostic,
viewer, or translation sources exist. Unauthenticated callers will be rejected
before stream acceptance or WebSocket upgrade behavior.

Authenticated callers will be able to request events after a cursor and receive
deterministic fixture events without making the dashboard daemon the ws MCP or
named-agent session authority.
